11.1. Create an application that has a side menu / side bar / navigation drawer and it has Settings (either have settings in the side menu or a link to a settings activity / fragment).

11.2. Create a text area where you give at least 50 characters. Create at least four different settings (font size, color, number of rows, height, width, etc.) that can modify how the text looks like

11.3. Create another text fields that the user can modify. Create an option in the settings that allows or blocks the edit of the aforementioned text field. At the same time, set the text field text created in 11.2 to have the text written in the field 11.3.

11.4. Create "Display text" (name can be changed) text field in the settings. The text in "display text" should be shown in the the main window (it could be like a name or username). Also create a language setting where the user can choose the application language (functionality doesn't have to be implemented).

11.5. Create texts for English and some other language and set the application to change languages based on a setting. Here are some links to help how it could be done.
